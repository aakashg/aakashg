# Hi, I'm Aakash

I build AI tools for product managers and ship working examples that PMs can use right away. 

Most of my work is hands-on: real prompts, tested Claude Code skills, and practical setups for PM workflows — PRD writing, competitive analysis, stakeholder updates, launch planning, and metrics definition.

I write [Product Growth](https://www.news.aakashg.com), the world's largest AI product management newsletter (215K+ subscribers), where I publish the complete deep dives and full toolkits.

### What I work on

- AI prompts for PM work: user stories, competitive teardowns, launch risk, metrics, status updates
- Claude Code skills: idea validation, design review, LinkedIn writing, prompt engineering
- PM operating system: CLAUDE.md configs, skill libraries, sub-agent setups
- Open source templates: PRD structures, project READMEs, profile guides
- Guides on AI product management: pricing, discovery, prototyping, agents, MCP
